this technology upgrade is driven by the need to modernize our infrastructure, enhance system performance, and prepare for enterprise-level expansion as we onboard new organizations. It's an essential step to ensure that our technology remains aligned with our business goals and capable of supporting our growth and innovation initiatives.
Title: "Modernizing Our Technology Stack for Improved Performance and Scalability"
I. Introduction
•	Modernization: Our current DATAX technology stack, which includes .NET MVC, AngularJS, and SQL Server, has served us well but has become outdated in the rapidly evolving tech landscape. To stay competitive and agile in today's digital world, it's crucial to modernize our technology stack. This involves adopting more contemporary tools and frameworks that offer enhanced capabilities, better performance, and greater flexibility.
•	Performance: One of the key drivers for this upgrade is the need for improved performance. Our existing system may struggle to meet the demands of our growing user base and evolving requirements. The new technology stack, with Angular 15 and modern backend technologies, is designed to deliver significantly better performance. Faster load times, improved responsiveness, and overall smoother user experiences are expected outcomes of this upgrade.
•	Enterprise-Level Upgrade: DataX will grows and we onboard new CIO’s as per Enterprise SIAI, we need a technology stack that can scale with ease and accommodate the increasing complexity of our operations. The microservices architecture and MongoDB as our database will allow us to scale different parts of our application independently, ensuring that we can meet the demands of both our current and future enterprise-level requirements.
Our current technology stack comprises .NET MVC for server-side development, AngularJS for the front-end, and SQL Server as the relational database management system. While this stack has been reliable and functional over the years, it presents several limitations that are impeding our ability to meet evolving business needs and market demands. Let's explore these limitations:
1.	Outdated Front-End Framework (AngularJS):
•	AngularJS, while groundbreaking in its time, is now considered outdated. It lacks the performance optimizations and modern development practices found in newer versions of Angular.
•	Limited support and diminishing community resources make it challenging to address security vulnerabilities and compatibility issues efficiently.
•	Slower page load times and decreased user experience are common issues associated with AngularJS, impacting customer satisfaction and engagement.
2.	Monolithic Architecture (MVC):
•	Our monolithic MVC architecture makes it difficult to scale different components of the application independently. Scaling requires deploying and managing larger units of the application, resulting in inefficient resource utilization.
•	Development and deployment cycles are slower due to the interconnected nature of monolithic systems, making it harder to deliver timely updates and new features.
3.	Rigid Schema (SQL Server):
•	SQL Server, as a relational database, enforces a rigid schema that can be limiting in a rapidly changing business environment. Modifying database schemas can be time-consuming and risky.
•	As we expand and onboard new organizations, the relational model may struggle to adapt to diverse and evolving data structures, potentially causing data modeling and integration challenges.
4.	Scalability Challenges:
•	Our current tech stack faces challenges in scaling horizontally to accommodate increasing user loads and data volumes. This could result in performance bottlenecks and downtimes during peak usage periods.
•	It lacks the inherent support for microservices architecture, which can limit our ability to efficiently add new functionalities and onboard partner organizations.
5.	Limited Flexibility:
•	The combination of MVC, AngularJS, and SQL Server makes it challenging to explore and integrate new technologies, frameworks, and tools. This lack of flexibility can hinder innovation and the adoption of cutting-edge solutions.
6.	Cost Implications:
•	The licensing costs associated with SQL Server can be significant, especially as our data requirements grow. Migrating to a more cost-effective database solution is essential to optimize our operational expenses.
In light of these limitations, it is evident that our current tech stack no longer aligns with our business goals and the demands of the modern digital landscape. To overcome these challenges and position ourselves for growth, innovation, and improved performance, we are embarking on a comprehensive technology upgrade, embracing Angular 15, Python Flask microservices, FastAPI, and MongoDB as our new technology stack. This transition will address these limitations head-on and enable us to thrive in an increasingly competitive environment.
